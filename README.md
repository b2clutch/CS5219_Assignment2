# Student Fuzzer
Template repository for CS5219

## Setup
Install all dependencies needed by the Fuzzing Book baseline fuzzer with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You may want to do this in a Python **virtual environment** to avoid global dependency conflicts.

## Usage

This `bug.py` file should have two functions: an `entrypoint` that is fuzzed by the fuzzer and `get_initial_corpus` function which returns a list of initial inputs for the fuzzer.
